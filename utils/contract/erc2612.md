title: ERC-2612 | Implement Gasless Token Transfer
---

ERC-2612 is a standard for gasless token transfer. It allows users to transfer tokens without having to pay for gas in Ether. The gas fee is paid by the caller of the contract's function.

There is a custom function to be created like `send()` function that would transfer the function with sender's (token holder/owner) signature on the transaction. The function would be called by the spender and the gas fee would be paid by the spender of the function.

For,

- code, refer [this](../../sc-sol-foundry/src/GaslessTokenTransfer.sol).
- test, refer [this](../../sc-sol-foundry/test/GaslessTokenTransfer.t.sol).
