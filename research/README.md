## MEV

MEV protection layer on top of Ethereum would be a way to protect the Ethereum network from MEV attacks like front-running, sandwitch and tx reordering (by miners). The waiting txs in mempool are exploited by MEV bots.
> Mempool is inevitable in a blockchain. Otherwise, txs sent to RPCs by sender might not be available to all validators.

## L2 scaling

This is about channels, rollups (ZK, Optimistic), and sharding.
