// Certainly! Here's an example of a Solidity contract where you can set the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) related to DeFi in the constructor:

/* 

In this contract, the constructor takes the APY as an argument and sets it as a state variable. The APY is provided with 18 decimal places for precision, similar to how Ether and most ERC20 tokens work in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The `calculateInterest` function calculates the interest based on the principal amount and the number of days. Note that this is a simple interest calculation and does not account for compounding interest. You could modify the contract to include compounding interest if desired.

To deploy the contract with an APY of 5.5% (0.055 in decimal representation), you would use the following value as the constructor argument:

```
0.055 * 10^18 = 55000000000000000000
```
