# Voting

## Overview

- Open voting system (anyone can vote & the vote is public)
- Token-weighted voting (the weight of a vote is proportional to the number of tokens the voter has)
- Commit-reveal voting (the vote is secret until the end of the voting period)
- Zero-knowledge proof based voting (the vote is secret even after the end of the voting period)
